# Henry's Budget LinkTree

LINK COMING SOON!

I didn't want to pay for a linktree for my socials and everything, so I decided to make it one of my personal projects/portfolio in a way where I can display my engineer and producer hobbies simutaneously.

This project uses HTML and CSS to design a simple LinkTree style single website for me to display my personal hobbies and connect with fellow peers.
