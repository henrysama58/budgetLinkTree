# poorLinkTree
I didn't want to pay for a linktree for my socials and everything, so I decided to make it one of my personal projects/portfolio in a way where I can display my engineer and producer hobbies simutaneously.

This project uses HTML and CSS to design a simple Linktree style website for me to display my personal hobbies to whoever wants to know me.

This project is also a way for me to connect with either different engineers, and/or different producers and artists.
